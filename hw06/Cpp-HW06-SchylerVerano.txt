1. Libraries are useful because they provide pre-written code that programmers can reuse, saving time and effort. They allow developers to perform common tasks—like image processing, file handling, or math operations—without having to write everything from scratch.

2. The two types of libraries are static and dynamic (or shared) libraries. Static libraries are compiled into the program at build time, making the executable larger but self-contained, while dynamic libraries are linked at runtime, allowing multiple programs to share the same library code and reducing file size.

3. Using a package manager is better because it automatically downloads, installs, and configures the library and its dependencies, saving time and reducing errors. Compiling a library yourself is useful when you need a custom configuration, a specific version not available through the package manager, or optimizations for your system.

main.o: main.cc
g++ -c -Wall -Werror -std=c++17 -I/usr/local/include main.cc

main: main.o
g++ -o main main.o -L/usr/local/lib -lpng

clean:
rm -f *.o main


5. A struct is a user-defined data type in C++ that groups together related variables under a single name. It’s useful for organizing data that belongs together, like storing the red, green, and blue values of a pixel in one object.
